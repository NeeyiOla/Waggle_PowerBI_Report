# Project Title
Lapcat vs Lapdog - Performance & Viability Report for Smart Pet De

# My Role
**Business Intelligence Analyst/Power BI Developer**

- Analysed Lapcat prototype vs Lapdog product data.
- Created engaging, executive-level dashboard using Power BI.
- Applied Waggle brand guidelines including logo, color palette, and iconography.
- Built interactive filters, navigation buttons, and bookmarks to enhance exploration.
- Delivered insights to inform product strategy, marketing, and go-to-marketing decisions



# Project Overview 
As a **Business Intelligence Analyst** for **Waggle*, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their Lapdog device, a **fitness collar that lets owners track their dog's steps, alerts them when it's time for a walk, and even repels fleas**! Reviewa have been fantastic, Sales are growing, and-best of all-the product really works!  


This success has led Waggle's CEO to push for feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, **I have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready PowerBI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to finding from the dog collar Lapdog devices**. I am excited for the fact that my work will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will either help conince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.


# Problem Statement

  - Were ownera of Lapcat devices as satifies with the product as Lapdog owners?
- The chief Marketing officer would like your report to be "on-brand" by including only colors from the waggle color palatte, the waggle logo, and other approved logos and icons.
- The product team trusts ypu tp incorporate other visuals and insights as you see fit but is most interested in demoprahic comparision between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore  on their own.

- "As the **CMO**, I want brand consistency in visuals to maintain Marketing intergrity."
- "As the **Product Development Team**, We want to compare pet activity, satifaction, and demographics to tailor future prototypes."

# Methodology 
## Tool Used
## Development

General Approach to creating the Solution:
1. Understanding the data: 
Reviewed the included data model and business questions and identify which fields can be used to design metrics that answer the CEO's questions. (That's all, just understand the data!)
2. Developed one or more visulisations that specifically address the CEO's question about whether there was a difference in average daily steps over time between the two devices and how Lapcat owners rated their device compared to Lapdog owners.
3. Address the product  team's  request for demographic insights, using each of the following visuals at least once, Bar chart, Line chart, Table/Matrix, scatter plot, bubble map, and card.
4. Making sure my data visualisations and design an appropriate layout that emphasises the most important fings first, with the CEO's questions answered on the first page, insights about the differences between dogs and cats on the second, and insights about the families who own the pets on the third

7. Create at least two bookmark features. One must allow users to dynamically swap one visual out with different one and another must reset all applied filters on the page/
8. Create buttons that help the users navigate the created report. Buttons must respond when users hover them by changing color size.

They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore  on their own.









# Resources and Basic Requiremens: 
In support of this project a data model has already been provided in a Power BI file, as well as a variety of waggle marketing images and branding guidelines. My report would be enrich in a user friendly way by making sure it demostrate best practices in clean layout design and colour use, utlise at least 7 difference Power Bi visualisations, include buttons for navigation between pages and/or bookmarks, and satify the business project statement.


# Methodology 
## Tool Used
## Development

General Approach to creating the Solution:
1. Understanding the data: 
Reviewed the included data model and business questions and identify which fields can be used to design metrics that answer the CEO's questions. (That's all, just understand the data!)
2. Developed one or more visulisations that specifically address the CEO's question about whether there was a difference in average daily steps over time between the two devices and how Lapcat owners rated their device compared to Lapdog owners.
3. Address the product  team's  request for demographic insights, using each of the following visuals at least once, Bar chart, Line chart, Table/Matrix, scatter plot, bubble map, and card.
4. Making sure my data visualisations and design an appropriate layout that emphasises the most important fings first, with the CEO's questions answered on the first page, insights about the differences between dogs and cats on the second, and insights about the families who own the pets on the third
5. In my data visualisation, incorperatebthe branding elements requested by the Chief Marketing Officer.
6. About at least five slicers on each page with at least one example of a drop-down slicer, at least one example of a slider slicer, at least one example of a hierarchy slicer, at least one example of a slicer with "Select All" enabled, and one example of  a slicer with the search box enabled.
7. Create at least two bookmark features. One must allow users to dynamically swap one visual out with different one and another must reset all applied filters on the page/
8. Create buttons that help the users navigate the created report. Buttons must respond when users hover them by changing color size.

# Project Title
Comparitive Performance of Lapdog and Lapcat Smart device

# My Role
Business Intelligence Analyst




# Project Overview 
As a **Business Intelligence Analyst** for **Waggle*, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their Lapdog device, a **fitness collar that lets owners track their dog's steps, alerts them when it's time for a walk, and even repels fleas**! Reviewa have been fantastic, Sales are growing, and-best of all-the product really works!  


This success has led Waggle's CEO to push for feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, **I have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready PowerBI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to finding from the dog collar Lapdog devices**. I am excited for the fact that my work will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will either help conince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.


# Project Statement 

- The CEO is curious about the following questions:
  - Did the average daily steps ibrease for cats wearing the as they did for dogs?
  - Were ownera of Lapcat devices as satifies with the product as Lapdog owners?
- The chief Marketing officer would like your report to be "on-brand" by including only colors from the waggle color palatte, the waggle logo, and other approved logos and icons.
- The product team trusts ypu tp incorporate other visuals and insights as you see fit but is most interested in demoprahic comparision between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore  on their own.
